        <h3>Java Project</h3>
        <p>
          The first project is a tool that students can use to create and build
          their own logic circuits. As a student in CprE 281, where some people
          struggled to understand visually, how a circuit works for their labs,
          I decided that it would be useful if someone could simulate their
          project beforehand.

        <h3>Web</h3>
        <p>
          Although I am not very far into it, I plan to make a project that
          allows users to create a "party", or group, with their freinds and
          each person suggests a song to add to a spotify playlist, the rest of
          the people vote on it, and if it is voted enough then it will be
          added. I plan on adding some features like more voting weight
          depending on your listening history, which may make it more fair for
          people who listen to less popular genres.
